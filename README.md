## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caroline!

I'm a Chemical Engineering graduate making a focused transition into business analytics and data science. With a foundation in Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and real-world experience building business reports, I bring both analytical thinking and a continuous improvement mindset to solving problems with data.

Currently, I'm building a portfolio of projects that reflect real business scenarios â€” from sales trend analysis and customer segmentation to executive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI. I'm especially passionate about turning complex data into clear, compelling stories to drive smart decisions.

ðŸ“Œ Skills:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Tableau, Power BI
- Git, Jupyter, Excel

Letâ€™s connect â€” Iâ€™m actively seeking entry-level roles in business/data analytics where I can learn, grow, and make a measurable impact.
